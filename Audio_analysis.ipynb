                  " Hello, am I speaking to Ms. Tanya? Yes, Tanya here. Hi, I am Deepika calling from the research  team at Keto. You have an active SIP with us, is that right? Yes, yes. Okay, I just  wanted to have a quick word with you about your experience and just talk to you a little  bit for maybe just 2-5 minutes. Can we have a conversation right now? Okay, we can talk.  Okay, great. So, just wanted to understand how has your overall experience been with Keto so far?  It was good. Okay, okay. So, Tanya, we have recently launched a new product called  Health First. It's basically a health plan so you can avail discounts on ordering medicines  or getting any lab tests or even doctor consultations for that matter.  Are you aware of this Health First? Yes, I am aware of this. Okay, how did you find out about  it and what is your opinion on the product? I have found from the app, from the app itself.  Okay, and did you go through it? Did you get a chance to look at the benefits that you get  if you sign up for Health First? Yes, I have gone through this  service. Okay, did you find it to be useful for you in the future maybe sometime?  Yeah, maybe in future but not right now. Okay, is there a particular reason that you don't feel  like it would be of help to you? Sorry, is there a particular reason you don't feel like it will  be of help to you? Like, is there something that we can do better about the product that will,  you know, make it more useful for you? No, actually, I have recently done my health check,  so right now, I don't want to do it. Okay, got that.  Sure, so as of now, currently, we all have medical expenses, right? Even if it is our  day-to-day medicines that we, you know, buy. Currently, do you have like an insurance or  something that covers these expenses for you? No, actually, I am a student.  Okay, you're a student. Yes. Okay, got that. Sure, so just another word about Health First itself,  you mentioned that in the future, it might be of use to you but not currently. Just before that,  as you said that you've already gone through the benefits, were there any issues or challenges  that you might have faced in trying to understand, you know, what we are offering? Was there any  point of confusion at all that maybe we can help you out with? No, no, not right now. I don't have  any confusion. Okay, great. I also see here that you have claimed few rewards like as an SIP donor,  you get a few rewards from Keto. I see that you've claimed a few rewards. Do you have any recall of  what those rewards were and what made them, you know, interesting for you? No, I don't remember.  Okay, okay. Are you also aware of SIP benefits like SIP Protect or Medical Bill Reimbursement,  anything like that? Yes, I am aware. Have you utilized any of those benefits,  SIP Protect or Medical Bill Reimbursement? No, not right now. Okay, sure. Is there a particular  reason or you just don't feel the need of it? Or is there something that we can, you know,  clarify about these benefits that maybe we have not put the information enough over there? Is  there something like that that we can help? No, not right now. I don't feel that I have to use it.  Okay, okay. Got it. Anything else, any other challenges that you might have faced or anything  that you'd want to discuss about your experience with Keto so far? No, no, thank you. Thank you  so much for taking out this time, Tanya. I hope you have a great weekend. Okay, thank you. Bye.\n"

                  " Hello, am I speaking to Ms. Tanya? Yes, Tanya here. Hi, I am Deepika calling from the research  team at Keto. You have an active SIP with us, is that right? Yes, yes. Okay, I just  wanted to have a quick word with you about your experience and just talk to you a little  bit for maybe just 2-5 minutes. Can we have a conversation right now? Okay, we can talk.  Okay, great. So, just wanted to understand how has your overall experience been with Keto so far?  It was good. Okay, okay. So, Tanya, we have recently launched a new product called  Health First. It's basically a health plan so you can avail discounts on ordering medicines  or getting any lab tests or even doctor consultations for that matter.  Are you aware of this Health First? Yes, I am aware of this. Okay, how did you find out about  it and what is your opinion on the product? I have found from the app, from the app itself.  Okay, and did you go through it? Did you get a chance to look at the benefits that you get  if you sign up for Health First? Yes, I have gone through this  service. Okay, did you find it to be useful for you in the future maybe sometime?  Yeah, maybe in future but not right now. Okay, is there a particular reason that you don't feel  like it would be of help to you? Sorry, is there a particular reason you don't feel like it will  be of help to you? Like, is there something that we can do better about the product that will,  you know, make it more useful for you? No, actually, I have recently done my health check,  so right now, I don't want to do it. Okay, got that.  Sure, so as of now, currently, we all have medical expenses, right? Even if it is our  day-to-day medicines that we, you know, buy. Currently, do you have like an insurance or  something that covers these expenses for you? No, actually, I am a student.  Okay, you're a student. Yes. Okay, got that. Sure, so just another word about Health First itself,  you mentioned that in the future, it might be of use to you but not currently. Just before that,  as you said that you've already gone through the benefits, were there any issues or challenges  that you might have faced in trying to understand, you know, what we are offering? Was there any  point of confusion at all that maybe we can help you out with? No, no, not right now. I don't have  any confusion. Okay, great. I also see here that you have claimed few rewards like as an SIP donor,  you get a few rewards from Keto. I see that you've claimed a few rewards. Do you have any recall of  what those rewards were and what made them, you know, interesting for you? No, I don't remember.  Okay, okay. Are you also aware of SIP benefits like SIP Protect or Medical Bill Reimbursement,  anything like that? Yes, I am aware. Have you utilized any of those benefits,  SIP Protect or Medical Bill Reimbursement? No, not right now. Okay, sure. Is there a particular  reason or you just don't feel the need of it? Or is there something that we can, you know,  clarify about these benefits that maybe we have not put the information enough over there? Is  there something like that that we can help? No, not right now. I don't feel that I have to use it.  Okay, okay. Got it. Anything else, any other challenges that you might have faced or anything  that you'd want to discuss about your experience with Keto so far? No, no, thank you. Thank you  so much for taking out this time, Tanya. I hope you have a great weekend. Okay, thank you. Bye.\n"
